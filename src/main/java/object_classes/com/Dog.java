/*Object - Objects have states and behaviors. 
Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors -wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.*/

/*Class - A class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.*/

/*A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.*/

/*Local variables: Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. 
The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.*/

/*Instance variables: Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method. These variables are initialized when the class is instantiated. 
Instance variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor or blocks of that particular class.*/
